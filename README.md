# Iris-Project

The dataset used here is in-built available iris dataset.

## Problem Statement

To design a System that will classify the flower in three different categories based on their Sepal length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width using ANN. Here, you will use the IRIS dataset for training the model.


## Proposed Methodology

The Iris dataset has 150 observations or Rows and 5 atttibutes or Columns of Iris Flowers.

First four columns are - Sepal Length, Sepal Width , Petal Length, Petal Width, all are in cm.

The Last column is containing the Classes - ['setosa' 'versicolor' 'virginica']

As we are loading the dataset from sklearn, the dataset is already pre-processed.

So, the Classes are - [ 0 , 1 , 2 ] instead of ['setosa' 'versicolor' 'virginica'].

Necessary steps are done to build,compile and fit the ANN model.


 ## Result
 
 The accuracy of the model created is 77.78%
 
 Prediction for first 10 observations is done and the flower is successfully classified in three different categories, that is, setosa,virginica,versicolor based on  
 
 their Sepal length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width.
